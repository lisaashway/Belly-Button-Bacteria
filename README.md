# Interactive-Dashboard


In this repo, you will find files that create an interactive dashboard that displays visualzations on bacteria found in a variety of test subjects' belly buttons. Ew, but - also kinda cool! It can be found here:
https://bellybuttonbacteria-1.herokuapp.com/

This project uses plotly for javascript to display the graphs, bootstrap css, d3, and flask to run the webpage as a python app deployed on heroku.
